				<h1>About Joshua</h1>
				<p>I am Joshua Oluwasayo Oyeleke. I am a student of University of Ilorin and University of the People. I
					am currently studying Computer Science at both institutions. It may sound crazy. Yeah! That is to
					tell you of how much I love Computer Science. I also study at Software Devevelopment at EKOBITS ICT
					Academy</p>
				<p>As a front-end developer, I currently work as a freelancer. I love my job and I look forward to
					honing more skills to be able handle more problems. That is the beauty of everything - solving real
					life problems.</p>
				<p>I love working in teams with people with different skills, experiences and opinions in order to
					achieve a common goal. Most of the time, I do not work alone. If you are interested in working with
					me, or you want me to work together with you in order to get a work done, feel free to contact me.
					Real life problems cannot be solved by competing but by collaborating. The praises belong to all the
					team members not to the leader of the group. This is my believe about life generally.</p>
				<p>In my leisure time, I love reading. It is part of my life. I cannot do without adding to myself each
					day. I always aspire to acquire everything relevant to my life that I have not been able to and may
					not be able to get in the classroom. I read books relating to my career, leadership, time
					management, other cultures, and so on.</p>
				<p>Besides reading, I attend seminars both paid and free. I love investing in my future first before
					investing in material things and the more I do that, the more those material things come. Attending
					seminars and meetings has also given me the opportunity to meet a lot of people I may never have
					been able to meet with if not because of the programme. The network I have built overtime (and still
					building) has increased my networth immensely.</p>
				<p>I love music also. Music is life. I developed interest in music while I was young and since then, my
					love for music has been waxing stronger each day. I love sight-playing classical music. It gives me
					the privilege to stretch my brain and learn eyes-to-hand coordination which is a skill that is very
					important in life.</p>
				<p>Although I am not a writer, I always try to express my mind by vomitting ink on paper. This help me
					at times to communicate better. It also helps me to pass across any message I intend to send over a
					distance. Most of the time, I write poem and sometimes, I write articles. I write based on personal
					experience and sometimes from what I have observed from people around me. Writing forces me to think
					and use my imagination. I love writing.</p>
